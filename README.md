# Extending-the-simple-web-server
WebServer,External processes

# Introduction:

This assignment consist in an implementation of a web server used to get http request and response
The server in particular has to be an extension of the “simple http server”
(latemar.science.unitn.it/segue_userFiles/2015WebArchitectures/src.zip) which has the possibility to
handle dynamic web pages as well as static web pages.
Static web pages are pages where the user can only view the content provided by the author and
also, the content of the page does not change.
Dynamic pages instead, are web page whose content, at least in part, is generated by the server at
the moment. Therefore the content could change each time the page is invoked.
In our particular case the server, once taken the get request, has to parse it and then decide if the
request resource consist in a static or dynamic page and response according to this.
In the case where the request ask for a static page, then the response will consist in the simple static
page requested, if any.
Whether the page requested is dynamic, the server will executes the external process indicated in
the request,if any, catching and printing its output, which has to be in html format. Furthermore
parameters can be passed to the process and in this case they have to be present in the request.
